# Bootstrap Lesson Challenge

##### Create a table and style it with bootstrap (I've made a simple HTML table and applied .table-hover to it.

I've copied pasted the table from stack overflow and adjusted it to the challenge.

I am not sure if I should have built the table with HTML5 (as I did) or using CSS' divs.

## ***Challenge Grid***
(I've some questions after trying to solve this challenge)

How to avoid white spaces? (I used 0 margin and padding but still saw whitespace)
How to fixate my grid so it doesn't dissapear when I change browser size (after many attempts, I used width:auto, is there a better way?)
why does it dissapear when trying to see on a some small devices? (I was able to see my name is most devices, except phones qieh under 400px res)
